# Token details
This file contains all the details of PLTM, our governance token.

***Note** Changes to this document should be expected and are pending. Changes may be made at any time.*

## Quick info
- 100,000,000 tokens
- ETH or Matic chain, to be decided
- Liquid democracy voting
- PLTM will be the ticker
- Plutum will be the name, but often referred to as PLTM to distinguish

## How will the tokens be awarded?
The tokens will all be pre-created, and broken down in the following ways:
- 24% going to team and advisors
- 76% going to community

## What are community tokens?
Community tokens are all tokens that won't go to the team or advisors. They will be used to get the token into people's hands, award grants to projects built on Plutum, and provide funding for ongoing development. They will be distributed as follows (percentages being of community tokens):
- 40% to the Plutum Foundation, which is a development/maintenance fund
- 25% will be offered for sale, with 25% of the sale allocation going to presale
- 20% to an outreach fund, which provides development grants to projects on PLTM
- 10% will go to airdrops
- 2% will go to bug bounties
- 3% will be held for use by the governance fund

The governance fund will hold funds that are to be spent by the token holders through governance features to invest in projects built on Plutum, award PLTM to marketing projects, and anything else approved through the proposal system.

Note that Plutum Foundation funds will also fall under jurisdiction of the governance features, but will have more restrictions on how they can be spent.
