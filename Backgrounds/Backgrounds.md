# Phone and computer backgrounds
Hi,

Unfortunately, our designer has a little too much time on his hands and manages to get no work done, confusingly enough. Fortunately for you, however, the culmination of his wasted time are these terrific backgrounds you can use on your devices. They're uploaded below! We've got backgrounds for iPhone and for Mac, however, we're working on getting more and offering more colourful options. If you have any suggestions, open an issue and we'll take note of it right away.

Thanks,
Cameron

## Background list
- iPhone X/11/12 (should be compatible with any iPhone that doesn't have insane dimensions)
- Macbook Pro (should be compatible with nearly any Mac from the last decade)
