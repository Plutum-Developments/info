# Plutum Developments
This is the core organisation that contains all of the code behind Plutum, a next-generation NFT project working to make the world and our transactions more connected than ever.

## What is the info repository?
The info repository is pretty self-explanatory - it contains all the documentation, information, and other materials that may be published or pushed online.

## Got any questions?
Email hello@plutum.org, DM our Twitter, or ask on our Discord. We like to pride ourselves on quick answers and are open to any and all feedback!

## Where is all the documentation?
Documentation is either located here or at https://docs.plutum.org. For the most part, they should have the same documentation uploaded to them. However, note there may be a slight time lag between the two. Also, this repository has all information, whereas the official docs have information that isn't otherwise available on the website, such as timeline.
